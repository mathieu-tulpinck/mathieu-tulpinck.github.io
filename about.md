I started my education in IT in September 2019, transitioning from the paper-based world of lawyering. Up until then my realm was the Microsoft Office suite and email clients. [Graham Lee](https://twitter.com/iwasleeg) says that Excel is the most popular IDE in the world. By that token, I had some measure of experience with an IDE. Apart from that, I had never done programming as such. More importantly, I lacked the basic reference points to orient myself in the IT space. This blog is meant to alleviate some of this struggle for newcomers and point them in the right direction. Perhaps more experienced tech ruminants will also find some useful bits.
